Sunrise IDE ROM is copyright by Sunrise for MSX.

Previously, we provided 3 different ROMs, but now there's only one. The older
ROMs are still located in the "old" and "old1" subfolders.

The current ROM file "FDD-IDE_V21.ROM" contains a slightly patched version
of the Sunrise IDE ROM and the Release version of the Nextor 2.1.1 IDE ROM
that natively supports Carnivore2 and FDD-IDE controllers. This ROM is faster
and has the slave device detection disabled. It is 262kb in size.

The "FDD-IDE_V21_29F040.ROM" is the file that you can burn directly into the
29F040 FlashROM chip. It is 512kb in size and contains the same data as the
"FDD-IDE_V21.ROM" file.

See the readme.txt file for more info.
